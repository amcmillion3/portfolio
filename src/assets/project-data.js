        learning: "This project was built so I could learn React Router. React Router is used to set up all the routes for the different rendered pages of the site. I endured several pain points not related to React Router while building the project. One particular difficulty was with how props are passed between nested children. Props are passed several children deep in the component tree. While this is completely functional it was difficult to manage mentally at first. To solve this issue I drew a diagram of a tree with each node representing a component and inside that component node I wrote down all the data that it needed to contain in order to function.",

        learning: "When approaching this project I laid out a basic sketch of what components I would use and saw the project would be pretty straight forward. There were several new things I worked on with this project. I brought in several third party libraries to handle things such as the image carousel and the small revealing animations on the menu. I gained valuable experience on how to install and use third party libraries and read through their respective documentation in order to use them effectively. ",
