        learning: "This project was built so I could learn React Router. React Router is used to set up all the routes for the different rendered pages of the site. I endured several pain points not related to React Router while building the project. One particular difficulty was with how props are passed between nested children. Props are passed several children deep in the component tree. While this is completely functional, it was difficult to manage mentally at first. To solve this issue, I drew a diagram of a tree with each node representing a component and inside that component node I wrote down all the data that it needed to contain in order to function.",

        learning: "When approaching this project I laid out a basic sketch of what components I would use and saw the project would be pretty straight forward. There were several new things I worked on with this project. I brought in several third party libraries to handle things such as the image carousel and the small revealing animations on the menu. I gained valuable experience on how to install and use third party libraries and read through their respective documentation in order to use them effectively. ",

        learning: "This was a project I built with React to become comfortable with Functional Components and Hooks. How state functions and how data is shared in a React app was confusing at first but once I read through the official docs and played with the sample code in the React docs I figured it out and made it work.",

        learning: "When I first started reading about what an API is I instantly thought of building a Pokédex. A few of the APIs I looked at had very simple data. I was intrigued by having so much data about every Pokémon and what I could do with all the data. I used axios to fetch the data from the API. It handled things much smoother than the built in Javascript methods for fetching data, specifically in it's error handling. This project utilizes React and Tailwind for managing and styling the UI.",

        learning: "In this project I focused on making the project look as good as possible. I was intent on designing it in a way that was sleek and clean. I ensured that it was responsive on different size devices and more than just increasing in size changing parts of the layout for different screen sizes. This project continued my work with React and Tailwind as both are the foundation of the site. A new thing I learned for this project is how to deploy a website. I purchased the domain and deployed the site. This site felt to me as really bringing together many of the crucial aspects of front end development that I have been working on.",
