# Andrew McMillion Personal Portfolio
A Collection of my Personal Projects
## Description
### This Personal Portfolio was built
to showcase my web development skillset, and to display a handful of projects for which I am most proud.

### My Learning Experience
In this project I focused on making the project look as good as possible. I was intent on designing it in a way that was sleek and clean. I ensured that it was responsive on different size devices and more than just increasing in size changing parts of the layout for different screen sizes. This project continued my work with React and Tailwind as both are the foundation of the site. A new thing I learned for this project is how to deploy a website. I purchased the domain and deployed the site. This site felt to me as really bringing together many of the crucial aspects of front end development that I have been working on.
